#### Instructions for the execution of codes 

Please follow the below instructions to run the code.
1. Download the MATLAB app from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16GTG-9JxCSyHSQWgUPHUm_QGFJDvMIvV?usp=sharing
2. Install the app using BMAS_AppInstaller_web.exe in the package.
3. Run the BMAS_for_PWI.exe 

This application allows you to:
      (i) Vary the hyper-parameters (L and s) and reconstruct the B-mode images for various datasets using the BMAS beamformer.
      (ii) Tune the hyperparameters and see a transition from DAS beamforming to DMAS beamforming for the selected datasets.
